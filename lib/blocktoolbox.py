ContourTracking2D: This function performs the tracking of the blocking events. It takes as input the output dataset of any of 
the functions DAV, GHA or LWAA. It then returns a dataset similar to the input dataset but with an additional variable that
has the same dimensions as the geopotential height field and identifies each blocked grid cell with a label that is unique for
each blocking event. In addition to this, this function returns a dictionary object where all the characteristics of the blocking
events are stored.

Inputs:
dataset: input dataset that must be the output of any of the functions DAV, GHA or LWAA, Xarray Dataset
var_name: the name of the variable contained inside of the dataset ('DAV', 'GHA' or 'LWAA'), String
geop_name: the name of the geopotential height contained inside of the dataset. This is needed for computing the intensity, String
overlap: the overlap criteria sets the portion of area that two consecutive blocking days must share to be considered as the same
block. It must be in the range [0,1], Float
save_track: flag to set whether the center of mass has to be computed.
save_intensity: flag to set whehter the intensity has to be computed.

Returns:
dataset: the input dataset + the tracked events matrix
dic: a list of dictionaries containing the features of the tracked events. The element 0 of the list is null and the index of the
other elements correspond to the label of the blocking event. The structure of one element of the list is the following:
dic[event_label]:
{'persistence': the number of days the blocking event lasts. Int,
'avg_area': the average area of the blocking event during its life cycle. Float [km^2], 
'avg_aspect_ratio': the average aspect ratio (lon_ext/lat_ext) of the blocking event during its life-cycle. Float, 
'distance_traveled': the total distance traveled during the event life-cycle. Float [km], 
'track': the track of the center of mass of the blocking event. (xs (List),ys(List)), 
'date': the date of the first day of the blocking event. np.DataTime64 (first blocking day),
'intensity': the average magnitude of the geop height anomaly in the blocked area during the blocking life-cycle. Float [m], 
'avg_dist_traveled': distance_traveled/persistence. Float [km]}

FilterEvents: This function applies a set of filters to the blocking events detected through ContourTracking2D. It takes as an input
both the dataset and the dictionaries produced by the tracking algorithm and it updates them following a persistence, area and
distance_traveled criteria.

Inputs:
dataset: input dataset that must be the output ContourTracking2D, Xarray Dataset
var_name: the name of the variable contained inside of the dataset ('DAV', 'GHA' or 'LWAA'), String
pers_min: the minimum persistence that a blocking event must have, Int
min_avg_area: the minimum area of a blocking event in km^2, Float
max_avg_dist: the maximum per day distance traveled by a blocking event in km, Float

Returns:
dataset: the fitered input dataset
dic: the filtered input dictionary
